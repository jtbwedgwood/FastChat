In other words, a quantum object can be described as a combination of its different possible states, rather than as a single definite state, until it is observed.  This is known as the Superposition Principle.  Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that arises from the act of superposing quantum states, in which the state of one quantum object is completely correlated with the state of another distant object, despite the fact that they are separated by large distances and/or have no physical interaction with each other.  Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property of the quantum mechanical nature of reality itself, and is not explicable in terms of classical physics or local hidden variables.", "My response is based on the assumption that the reader has a basic understanding of quantum physics and the relevant background concepts, and is primarily intended to be informative rather than persuasive.
